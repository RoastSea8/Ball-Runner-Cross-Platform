# Ball Runner Cross-Platform Application
The current implementation of the application has been suited only for my Lenovo ThinkPad, which might produce disproportional images or incorrect coordinates for objects on other devices.
- The ThinkPad for which the dimensions are currently set is a [Lenovo ThinkPad T460s](https://www.lenovo.com/us/en/laptops/thinkpad/thinkpad-t-series/ThinkPad-T460s/p/22TP2TT460S).
### How it looks
Note: The video's frame rate is much lower than that of the actual game

### How to set up and run
- The `.idea` folder already has configurations for the PyCharm IDE, so you can simply open it up in PyCharm and run `main.py`
- If you are using a different IDE
  - Install Kivy by following instructions on the official Kivy [documentation](https://kivy.org/doc/stable/gettingstarted/installation.html#install-pip)
  - Remember to have your Python interpreter configured for the project
- Run the `main.py` file    
- Click your mouse to jump
